As AI quickly evolves, questions arise concerning how AI will be used for the development of applications. Is it the primary job of a software engineer to write code still, or are we approaching a time where software engineers are more like managers and prompt engineers for code: giving direction to an AI and refining the results?

In this experiment, I ask ChatGPT o1 to create digital rain on a single webpage. Needless to say, the result of this prompt is impressive...and it only took Chat 13 seconds to think it through (much longer to write out, however).
